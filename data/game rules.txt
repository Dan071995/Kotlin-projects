                                        ~~ Info ~~
The distribution center works as follows:
1) The user enters the number of ports for UNLOADING goods (3 for example);
2) The user enters the number of ports for LOADING goods (1 for example);
3) The user enters the number of TRUCKS that will be handled by the UNLOADING ports (3 for example).

Trucks with goods are generated every 0.5 seconds and contain a random number of goods of a random type. 
Depending on the quantity of goods and the type of truck, the time of its unloading depends. 
The truck occupies a free UNLOADING port and unloads the goods to the Distribution Center. If all ports are occupied,
the truck is placed in a waiting queue. 
After UNLOADING N trucks (user-defined), the work of the UNLOADING ports is completed, and the information is
transmitted to the LOADING ports that the UNLOADING ports have completed their work. 
Further, the LOADING ports stop accepting new trucks, load those vehicles that are already on LOADING and complete their work.
This stops the program.
