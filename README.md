# Brief description (detailed description can be found in the file "ТЗ к курсовой.docx"):

The distribution center is a building with a limited number of loading and unloading ports. Trucks filled with goods arrive at the ports of unloading. The goods in the truck are moved one by one to the warehouse of the distribution center within the time specified in the characteristics of the goods. The truck is at the port of unloading until the last of the goods transported by this truck enters the warehouse.
An empty truck leaves the distribution center and is no longer counted. The next truck pulls up to the vacant unloading port.
